# LittleGooseOfficial

This project was originally started as my graduation design in college. The code is still a bit rough, but it is my first relatively complete project. I will continue to improve and maintain this open-source project in the future.

I am the product manager, designer, and developer of this project. Due to my limited ability, you may see the shadow of many other software in this project. If you have any suggestions, please feel free to submit an issue.

I will put all my knowledge into practice in this project, including interaction design, UI design, motion design, and programming.

I strive for the best practices in all areas. The project is constantly being refactored. Therefore, if you see the code in the blog is inconsistent with the code in the project, please contact me to modify the blog content, or go to the /ver/xml branch to view the code from the previous stage. The code was placed in this branch before the most recent major refactoring.
